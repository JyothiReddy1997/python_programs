-------------------
A separate (optional) problem you could consider writing is based on a problem in Douglas
Hofstadter’s Pulitzer-prize-winning book Gödel, Escher, Bach. That book contains many
interesting mathematical puzzles, many of which can be expressed in the form of computer
programs. In Chapter XII, Hofstadter mentions a wonderful problem that is well within
the scope of what you know. The problem can be expressed as follows:
Pick some positive integer and call it n.
If n is even, divide it by two.
If n is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Continue this process until n is equal to one.

def main():
    print("Hail Stones")
    n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
    while not n==1:
        if (n%2==0):
            n=int(n/2)
        else:
            n= 3*n+1
        print(str(n))


# This provided line is required at the end of a Python file
